Its an simple Script to sort your Pictures after Year and Month.
You put in an Folder where it can find all pictures.
The Output Folder will be filled with copies of the pictures in Folders of the Form:
Year -> Month -> [Pictures]

Its basically my first project with Python and my first thing on Github swell.
